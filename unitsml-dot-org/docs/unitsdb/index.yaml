              The UnitsDB contains detailed units and dimensionality information
              for an extensive number of SI units and common, non-SI units. The
              database includes information needed to reference units in an XML
              document, and specifically includes:

              In addition to scientific units, the database will include
              information about common quantities (e.g., length, mass),
              including the dimension of quantities with respect to the 7 base
              quantities.
