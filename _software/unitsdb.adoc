The UnitsDB contains detailed units and dimensionality information for an extensive number of SI units and common, non-SI units. The database includes information needed to reference units in an XML document, and specifically includes:

* Unique identifiers
* Unit symbols
* Language-specific unit names
* Representations in terms of other units (including conversion factors)

In addition to scientific units, the database will include information about common quantities (e.g., length, mass), including the dimension of quantities with respect to the 7 base quantities.

UnitsDB in its entirety
can be found in this UnitsDB Github repository.
