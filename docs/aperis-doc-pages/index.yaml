                      2003: The “Units Markup Language (UnitsML)” presentation
                      was given at the Open Forum 2003 on Metadata Registries,
                      with work led by Bob Dragoset of NIST. Collaborators
                      included Barry Taylor (NIST emeritus), Michael McLay
                      (NIST), Frank Olken (LBNL) and Peter Murray-Rust (CML -
                      Chemical Markup Language). The work was funded in part by
                      NIST’s Systems Integration for Manufacturing Applications
                      (SIMA) program.

                      2006: The UnitsML work was proposed by NIST’s Physics
                      Laboratory (“PL”) to be standardized, and was inducted
                      into a new OASIS TC of the same name “UnitsML” sponsored
                      by NIST. The Convenor of the TC was Simon Frechette (NIST
                      MEL-SIMA). Collaborators included Mark Carlisle (NIST
                      MEL-SIMA), Bob Dragoset (NIST PL), Karen Olsen (NIST PL),
                      Gary Kramer (NIST CSTL), Peter Lindstrom (NIST CSTL), Kent
                      Reed (NIST BFRL), Evan Wallace (NIST MEL), Ismet Celebi,
                      Ronny Jopp and Alexander Roth.

                      2016: The OASIS TC for UnitsML was closed due to
                      completion of work at that stage.
