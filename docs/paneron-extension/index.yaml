              UnitsML allows encoding of scientific units of measure and
              quantities into XML and will validate XML documents that use
              UnitsML. Initial development of this schema was done at NIST, but
              completion of the development process should include input from
              the international scientific and engineering community. Towards
              this end, we are initiating an OASIS Technical Committee to
              address any needed changes in the schema and publish a final
              recommendation.

              We anticipate that UnitsML will be used by the developers of other
              markup languages to ad- dress the needs of specific communities
              (e.g. mathematics, chemistry, materials science, etc.). The
              UnitsML schema is not intended to be a standalone schema, but
              rather to be used in combination with other specific schemas
              through the appropriate use of namespaces.
